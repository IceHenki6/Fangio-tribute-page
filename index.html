          <h2>1951</h2>
          <p>1950 was a great year for Fangio, finishing 2nd in the championship, but 1951 was the year when Fangio was going to become a Formula 1 world champion for the first time. Having won three races out of seven that year, in the Grand Prix of Switzerland, Reims (France), and the last race in Pedralves( pain), and with a fierce fight during the entire season with Giuseppe Farina and the two Ferraris of Alberto Ascari and the Argentinean Jose Froilan Gonzales.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>1954</h2>
          <p>After not being able to race in 1952 due to the withdrawal of Alfa Romeo from Formula One in consequence of a change in regulations and rejoining Formula One in 1953 with Maseratti finishing the championship 2nd; in 1954 Fangio became World Champion for the second time in his career. Fangio drove for Maseratti in the first two races and won both; in Argentina and Spa Francorchamps(Belgium). 
            In mid-1954, Fangio joined a new team that entered the category called Daimler Benz AG (Mercedes Benz). With them, Fangio won three more races in the Nuerburgring (Germany), Switzerland, and Monza (Italy) and so secured his second Formula One World Championship.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>1955</h2>
          <p>The success of Fangio continued in 1955 alongside his powerful team Mercedes. This year he fought against his young and super talented teammate Stirling Moss. Fangio won 4 races: in Argentina, Spa, The Netherlands, and Monza. He managed to win his third world title, but sadly 1955 was the last year of Mercedes in motorsport. 
            On the 11th of June of 1955, during the 24 hours of Le Mans race, a terrible accident occurred on the main straight, sending a car flying to the grandstands and killing around one hundred spectators. In this accident, Mike Hawthorn, Lance Macklin and two Mercedes drivers were involved. Pierre Levegh sadly lost his life in the accident, and Fangio miraculously avoided the crash. Fangio described the accident: “I saw everything, I was about to overtake the cars that crashed; Hawthorn, Macklin, and Levegh… The speed is around 250 km/h, 3 hours have passed since the start of the race, and It’s time to change drivers. Hawthorn slows down and directs his car to the pit entry. He started the manoeuvre way before the 300m of the pit entry, in the correct way. Macklin opens up a bit, just enough to overtake Hawthorn, and an instant after Klint heads to the pit. Then Levegh, going very fast, tries to pass but finds no space; his Mercedes runs over Macklin’s Austin rear. I cling to the steering wheel and wait for the hit that I don’t know why never comes. My Mercedes goes by a hair caressing the Austin, that crossed on the track rips the asphalt with its bodywork… behind me, I leave hell.”</p>

          <h2>1956</h2>
          <p>After Mercedes's retirement, Fangio signed with Ferrari. The car, the Ferrari-Lancia D-50 was a difficult car to drive and had reliability issues. These problems were not enough to stop Fangio from winning his 4th world championship, with three victories that year, in Argentina, Great Brittain at Silverstone, and Germany at the Nuerburgring.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>1957</h2>
          <p>In 1957, Fangio returned to Maserati and won 4 races, with the beautiful Maserati 250F. He wins in Argentina, Monaco, Reims (France), and at the Nuerburgring. This last race was called “The race of the century”. On the 4th of August, at the Nuerburgring, the longest circuit in the world with 22.810 km, Fangio made history again. He started the race from pole position with a 9:25.6 lap time. On lap 12, Fangio was leading the race by 30 seconds over the two Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins. Fangio makes a pit stop to change tyres and refuel, the pit stop was a complete disaster. He lost 45 seconds to the Ferraris that were on a non-stop strategy. After that, there were ten laps to the end of the race, and Fangio had to recover all the time he lost on that pit stop if he wanted to win the race and the championship. Fangio gave one of the most amazing and legendary driving performances in racing history, breaking the lap record lap after lap and cutting the difference between him and the Ferraris. On the last lap, he managed to overtake the cars of Collins and Hawthorn to take the lead of the race and win his 24th and final Grand Prix in Formula One. He also won his 5th and last world championship. Fangio set the fastest lap with a 9:17.4, eight seconds faster than the pole position lap.
            He described later on that in that race, he pushed over the limits and drove like never before. He said that he was never going to drive like that ever again.</p>
